# react-useState-demo

I wanted to practice coding under a time limit, so I set a timer to 3 hours and made this project. I also wanted to check out the new features added in React 16.6 (and 16.7 alpha),
I'll probably put them to better use once more people put them to practice and there are more best-practice examples.
